- Casting Classes:
  ----------------
The compiler permits casting only on super classes..!

Dog theDog = new Dog();	// Dog extends Animal
Cat theCat = new Cat();	// Cat extends Animal
  
Animal a = theDog;
Dog d = (Dog) a;	// Compiles and runs OK!
--------------------
Animal a = theCat;
Dog d = (Dog) a;	// Compiles - fails  at runtime!
  
- Casting with Interface types in assignments:
  --------------------------------------------
The compiler permits casting in any case..! (except of final classes)

Tiger theTiger = new Tiger();	// Tiger extends Animal
Puppy thePuppy = new Puppy();	// Puppy extends Animal AND implements Pet Interface
Rock theRock = new theRock();	// Rock just implements Pet Interface

Tiger -> Animal
Puppy -> Animal, Pet
Rock -> Pet

Pet thePet = (Pet) theRock;		// Compiles and runs OK!
Pet thePet = (Pet) thePuppy;	// Compiles and runs OK!
Pet thePet = (Pet) theTiger;	// Compiles - fails at runtime!
Tiger t = (Tiger) thePet;

Animal a = (Animal) thePet;	// OK in case thePet is thePuppy
							// NOK in case thePet is theRock!
