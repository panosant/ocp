- Static Fields
  -------------
Class (static)		// Created on compilation time!
Object (instance)	// Created on runtime!

"All the objects in a class SHARE the static fields of that class"

(non-static) instance variables (diff)
(static) class variables (shared)

- Static Methods
  --------------

public class Example {
	public static Integer x;
	public Integer y;	
}

Unqualified reference
---------------------
y = 99; 	// The compiler does not know which instance, so assumes:
this.y = 99;

Qualified reference
-------------------
Example ex = new Example();
ex.y = 99;	// Member variable of a specified instance
ex.x = 100;	// Class variable of a common class
