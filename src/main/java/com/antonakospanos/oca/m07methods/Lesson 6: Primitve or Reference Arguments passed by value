Method Local Variables!
-----------------------

i) PRIMITIVE ARG:
-----------------
int x = 99;
addOne(x);

// The value of int x is COPIED in the value of the local variable x of the method.
// Pass x variable by value!!!
// The value of int x of the class instance was NOT modified, was just COPIED!

void addOne (int x) {
	x++;
	system.out.println("x is "+ x);
}

Î½
ii) REFERENCE ARG:
------------------
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
addOne(sb);

// The value of sb is the pointer to StringBuilder object.
// Pass sb pointer by value!!
// The value of StringBuilder sb POINTER won't be modified.
// The value of StringBuilder sb OBJECT however may be modified!! (here WILL be modified) 

void addOne (StringBuffer sb) {
	sb.append(" World);
	system.out.println("sb is "+sb);
}

// The value of StringBuilder sb OBJECT won't be modified here!!
// The local sb uses a new pointer to another Object in the memory 

void addOne (StringBuffer sb) {
	sb = new StringBuilder("Goodbye!");
	system.out.println("sb is "+sb);
